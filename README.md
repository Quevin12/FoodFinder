# FoodFinder
 A simple android app built with Kotlin and android studio that gives meal suggestions based on the time of day.

OVERVIEW:
This app is designed to provide users with meal ideas instantly - just by typing in the time of day, for example, 'morning', 'afternoon'. or 'night.

Core functionality:
Users enter a time of day (e.g. `morning`, `afternoon`, or `night`). 
The app then checks a predefined `foodmap` list to pull meal suggestions for that time and if matches are found, they are displayed in a clean, readable list.

If no results are found, the app shows a friendly “no matches” message, where 'clear button' resets the input and results instantly.

Design Considerations

A Minimalist UI – A Clean layout with no extra screens, popups, or menus but only essential elements such as:
  - Input box
  - Button to request suggestions
  - Button to clear
  - Results display area
- Fun and friendly text keeps the user experience light and enjoyable.

User Experience Goals

- **Speed**: Instant feedback after user input.
- **Simplicity**: No complex navigation or settings.
- **Clarity**: Suggestions are clearly displayed.
- **Accessibility**: Handles lowercase input and trims extra spaces automatically.



 This app was built With Kotlin and Android Studio
